Lessons Learnt
This project really thought me everything can be styled and altered with CSS when your HTML is well organized. 
Taking time to write a good and understanble HTML file makes it easy to add value to it with CSS.

Added functionality
This project is not just responsive, the resolution of the image elements do not change or reduce with different viewports.
